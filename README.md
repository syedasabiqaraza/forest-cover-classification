#  Forest Cover Type Classification

This project predicts the **forest cover type** from cartographic and environmental features using machine learning models.  
The dataset used is the **Covertype (UCI)** dataset, which is a popular benchmark for multi-class classification tasks.

##  Project Overview
- Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset  
- Applied multi-class classification models  
- Compared **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**  
- Evaluated model performance with accuracy and confusion matrix  
- Visualized feature importance for interpretability
